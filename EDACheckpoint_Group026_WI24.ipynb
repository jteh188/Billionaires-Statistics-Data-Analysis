    "As of 2023, there are an estimated 2,640 billionaires in the world, with nearly 15% of the world’s billionaires in the finance industry, 13% in the manufacturing industry, and 12% in the technology industry.<a name=\"Forbes\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#Forbes) According to recent studies, roughly 11% of the world’s billionaires have either run for election or have held a political position, with former examples including Donald Trump, Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer.<a name=\"CNBC\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#CNBC) Oftentimes, these billionaires hold great amounts of political power through secret donations to political candidates, parties, and super PACs, and they also invest in crucial industries that allow them to have a lot of influence over their respective countries <a name=\"CNBC\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#CNBC). By analyzing how these billionaires currently spend their fortune and their origin of wealth, it may potentially lead to insights into how certain countries are operated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze data relating to billionaires’ net worth, source of wealth, age, gender, location, consumer price index of residency, tax revenue of residency, and many other factors.<a name=\"Kaggle\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#Kaggle) Our project aims to see whether or not there are specific trends and patterns among these billionaires and specific industries in high-income versus low-income countries. Our project also aims to determine whether there are specific traits among billionaires’ background and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous investigations <a name=\"InvestmentMigration\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#IvestmentMigration) indicate that there may be positive relationships between the number of billionaires, tax rates, quality of life, and GDP ratios in each country. However, there are mixed results in the research as to which factors are more important, so we can use the dataset we found to determine which ones may have the most impact (i.e. which are the most highly correlated) per country. As this research has been inconclusive, we aim to clarify the findings further. We will be categorizing industries into three different groups (primary, secondary, and tertiary) according to the three-sector model <a name=\"Fisher\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#Fisher). Primary industries focus heavily on extracting raw materials such as the mining industry. Secondary industries specialize in the manufacturing of goods such as the automotive industry. Lastly, the tertiary sector consists of industries that transport and distribute/sell manufactured goods such as the retail industry. This model will allow us to distinguish between different types of industries during our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also clear differences in the billionaire status based on gender. An article by the New York Times <a name=\"NYTimes\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#NYTimes)describes the statistics of these wealth differences on a global level, but there is less information on how this may vary by industry and country/location. We can look at the specific trends per industry and per country to see which ones tend to have more male versus female billionaires, and we may perform exploratory analyses to investigate why those may be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, different publications use different ways to collect the net worth of billionaires. For example, as of February 10th 2024, according to Forbes, the net worth of Bernard Arnault is 219.2B (the first place)<a name=\"Forbes2\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#Forbes2), but according to Bloomberg, his net worth is 191B (the third place) even though both websites are measured in real time and updated daily.<a name=\"Bloomberg\"></a>[<sup>8</sup>](#Bloomberg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, classifying the countries of origin by Income levels - High and Low- per the World Bank’s definition of High Income economies, provides a further level of analysis that can enrich the understanding of wealth accumulation throughout the world. It can provide a deeper insight into the economic conditions that lead to Billionaire status as well as differences among billionaires from their respective countries. <a name=\"WorldBank\"></a>[<sup>9</sup>](#WorldBank)\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of this study lies in the fact that billionaires often wield a disproportionate amount of power in shaping economic and social policy, as well as general social trends. Thus understanding the backgrounds of these people with immense power is vital to understanding broader societal trends, such as wealth inequality, social mobility, and tax policy. Additionally analyzing the different factors that may lead to billionaire status can help economists understand the systems of different countries and their effect on wealth accumulation and distribution.\n",

Some of the important variables that we will be looking at from this dataset include country, age, gender, and industries. The country variable will allow us to determine whether the billionaire resides in a high-income country or not by looking at the list of countries in the other dataset. Age and gender will be used to look at the personal characteristics of each billionaire which will help us find trends among the billionaires. Lastly, industries will be used to categorize each billionaire’s industry into one of the three industry sectors referenced earlier. We would likely want to add a column to denote high-income countries with values being True or False and another column to denote industry sector with values being Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.\n",

These classifications will then be used in comparing the results of our data analysis on various countries to see if we can determine any differences between the two classifications based on the three-sector model.

    "It seems like the data was gathered through publically available sources so it would not seem like we need to get consent from these public figures to include them in our study. It could be possible that some billionaires may have been left out because of being less well known or from smaller countries. Because we did not collect the data directly from the billionaires directly, there could be bias present in the data. We can maybe try to find the sources that were used to compile this data and see for oursleves if there may be any previous bias present. We also do not get insight into the backgrounds of these billionaires as some may have started with more money and thus had an easier time building their wealth. Additionally, it may be easier to become a billionaire in certain countries rather than others. In order to detect these biases, we may want to perform an exploratory analysis on the data to determine which countries might have a large proportion of billionaires compared to population. It may also be possible that gender and age bias regarding billionaire status and how calculations of wealth are determined. We could try to find more data about the ages that people first became billionaires."
